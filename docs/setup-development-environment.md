# Setup Development Environment

## System Setup

1. [Install and activate mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html)

2. Configure github CLI with `gh auth login` and ensure you have access to the repository (optional, for convenience).

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # - Install all the tools defined in mise.toml (python, uv, ...)
   # - Create .venv on the pinned Python and activate it
   mise install

   # Usually unnecessary: [deps.uv] in mise.toml runs `uv sync` automatically before any
   # `mise run` when uv.lock or pyproject.toml changed, or .venv is missing.
   mise run install

   # To recreate the virtualenv from scratch
   mise run reinstall
   ```

   Add and remove dependencies with `uv add` / `uv remove`, which update `pyproject.toml`
   and `uv.lock` together. (`mise deps add` does not support uv.)

   Run tools with `uv run <tool>` rather than bare — see
   [Building and Testing](building-and-testing.md) for why that matters when more than one
   project's virtualenv is in play.

## Editor and Claude Code Setup

The repository is already configured; what is left is per-machine installation.

- **Extensions** — accept the prompt on first open; the set is committed in
  [.vscode/extensions.json](../.vscode/extensions.json). [What each one is for, and which
  committed settings silently stop working without it][vscode].
- **Interpreter** — nothing to select. `.vscode/settings.json` and `[tool.pyright]` already
  point at `.venv`. [What those settings do, and why a reload is needed after changing
  them][pyright].
- **Plugins** — `.claude/settings.json` enables `iglootools` for the shared guidelines and
  `pyright-lsp` so Claude resolves symbols instead of grepping for them. A plugin the project
  enables still installs once per machine: [install per project][install], then
  [update one][update-one] or [all at once][update-all] on each release. For `pyright-lsp` see
  [Claude Code setup][claude-code] — it needs the virtualenv step above done first.
