# Setup Development Environment

## System Setup

1. [Install and activate mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html)

2. Configure github CLI with `gh auth login` and ensure you have access to the repository (optional, for convenience).

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # - Install all the tools defined in mise.toml (python, uv, ...)
   # - Create .venv on the pinned Python and activate it
   mise install

   # Usually unnecessary: [deps.uv] in mise.toml runs `uv sync` automatically before any
   # `mise run` when uv.lock or pyproject.toml changed, or .venv is missing.
   mise run install

   # To recreate the virtualenv from scratch
   mise run reinstall
   ```

   Add and remove dependencies with `uv add` / `uv remove`, which update `pyproject.toml`
   and `uv.lock` together. (`mise deps add` does not support uv.)

   Run tools with `uv run <tool>` rather than bare — see
   [Building and Testing](building-and-testing.md) for why that matters when more than one
   project's virtualenv is in play.

## VSCode Setup

Accept the recommended extensions when VSCode prompts on first open — the set is committed in
`.vscode/extensions.json`. See
[VSCode setup](https://github.com/iglootools/common-guidelines/blob/main/ide.md#vscode) in the
shared guidelines for what each one is for, and which committed settings silently stop working
without it.

No interpreter selection is needed: `.vscode/settings.json` and `[tool.pyright]` in `pyproject.toml`
already point the editor at `.venv`. See
[Pyright environment resolution](https://github.com/iglootools/common-guidelines/blob/main/ide.md#pyright-environment-resolution)
in the shared guidelines for what those settings do, how to verify them, and why a window reload is
required after changing them.

## Claude Code Setup

Both plugins below are enabled for this repository in `.claude/settings.json`, but a plugin the
project enables still has to be installed once per machine. Claude Code reports it as not
installed and prints the command until you do.

Install the shared iglootools guidelines:

```bash
claude plugin install iglootools@iglootools-plugins --scope project
```

Install the Pyright LSP plugin so Claude resolves symbols instead of grepping for them. Follow
[Claude Code setup in the shared guidelines](https://github.com/iglootools/common-guidelines/blob/main/ide.md#claude-code)
once the virtualenv step above is done — it covers the install command, why `pyright-langserver` has
to come from this project's `.venv`, and how to verify that it does.
