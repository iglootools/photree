# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture

Detailed overview of the architecture, design patterns, and execution flow: @docs/architecture.md

Internals (Image Capture file structure, album on-disk layout): @docs/internals.md

## Guidelines and Workflow

Before writing any code, apply the guidelines at write time, not as a post-hoc review. Walk the implementation checklist item by item before considering a task done.

Common guidelines shared across iglootools projects come from the `iglootools` plugin, enabled for
this repository in `.claude/settings.json`. It loads the always-on guidelines into every session,
and reads the file-triggered ones when a change reaches them. See
@docs/setup-development-environment.md to install it.

Project-specific guidelines: @docs/guidelines.md

Implementation checklists: @docs/implementation-checklists.md

## Code Navigation

Answer symbol questions with the Pyright LSP, not with text search: where something is defined, what
references or calls it, what type it returns, what a module contains. The `pyright-lsp` plugin is
enabled at project scope in `.claude/settings.json`. The same name appears in several modules here
(`check`, `refresh`, `ops`, `cmd_handler`), so a symbol answer must come from the import graph rather
than from text matches.

Reach for `grep`/`Glob` when the target is not a resolvable Python symbol — string literals, config
keys, YAML/TOML, comments, filenames, or a name that may not resolve. The LSP does not jump into
`site-packages` either, so third-party definitions still need the file read directly.
